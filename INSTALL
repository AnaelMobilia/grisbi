How to install Grisbi : 
=======================

Requirements:

 - GTK 2.4
 - libofx (optional)

Installation steps:

 - ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/grisbi
 - make
 - make install

Grisbi will now be installed.  Just run <prefix>/bin/grisbi and have
fun !

OFX support is optional and can be disabled by using the --without-ofx
parameter.

To use the print feature, make sure you have installed unicode support for
LaTeX (http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/).  Most distributions have
unicode support already enabled or only require that you install the latex-ucs
binary package.

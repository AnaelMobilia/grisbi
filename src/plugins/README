Grisbi provides several plugins that allow feature enhancement without
adding compile-time dependencies.

List of plugins:

 - Gnucash : import Gnucash files into Grisbi.

 - OFX : import OFX files into Grisbi.

 - OpenSSL : encryption support for Grisbi files.

To make them work, they need to be installed in <prefix>/lib/grisbi
(which is done by running "make install").

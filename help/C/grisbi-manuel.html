First of all, have you subscribe to Grisbi's 
<A HREF="mailto:infos@grisbi.org">infos mailing list</A>?<BR>
<BR>
You will receive only a few messages a year, about 
the new versions and the bugs fixes.<BR>
<BR>
So don't wait, do it just now!<BR>
<BR>

Since the 0.4.1 version, the user guide is no more integrated in the package of Grisbi.
Effectively, its ever-growing weight and its internationalisation obligend us to create 
a separate package.

<h1>The guide types</h1>

The user guide comes in two types:

<ul>

	<li>a text only type;</li>
	
	<li>an illustrated type, with many screenshots.</li>

</ul>

It is obvious that the second one is more pleasant to use but also more long to download.
So it's up to you...

<H1>Installing the guide</H1>

On <A href"http://www.grisbi.org">Grisbi's site</A> you'll find the package you need in the
section Dowload/Documentation. For the moment only the french version is avaliable.

Translators welcome! Send a mail to 
<a href="mailto:daniel@grisbi.org?Subject=[grisbi] Translation?Body=I can translate the user's guide in the following language :">Daniel</a>
if you want to help Grisbi.

<H2>Installing a package</H2>

As well as the programm, the guide is avaliable as packages deb or rpm.
However there are no specifics packages for the differents distributions.

Install tha package as you use to. The files will be placed in /usr/share/gnome/help/grisbi/C.

<H2>Installing by hand</H2>

If for any reason you need (or prefere) process the installation by hand, you must download the
archive manuel-grisbi-xxx-n.n.n.tar.gz where xxx is the version (text or illustrated, txt or img 
respectively) and n.n.n the version.

Untar this archive and copy all the  .html and .png files as well as the topic.dat in
 /usr/share/gnome/help/grisbi/C.
